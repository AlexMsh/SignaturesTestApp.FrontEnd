## Notes
Potential Improvements:

1. Reactive Forms could have been used for the posting page
	a. Would allow to control validation better
	b. Better approach in scope of unit testing
	Problem: would require a bit more effort
2. Bootstrap should be added & used as an npm reference
	Prolem: would take some time investigating why it didn't work "out of the box" (e.g. pretty sure it's all about the build/bundling/etc)
